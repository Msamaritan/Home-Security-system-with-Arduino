# Home-Security-system-with-Arduino
We are living in the society where the illegal activites are mastering among the population and many are using the technology so badly as they can, so we must also implement the same technology to protect ourselves!!
So with the idea of protecting our safest place in the entire world,our sweet home we can design the simple and affordable project. Let's see this in detail:

Hardwares used:
  Arduino Uno
  PIR motion detection sensor
  GSM module (SIM 900A)
  
Softwares Used:
  Arduino IDE
  
  
How it works ?
      PIR sensor detects motion by sensing the difference in infrared or radiant heat levels emitted by surrounding objects. The output of the PIR sensor goes high when it detects any motion. The range of a typical PIR sensor is around 6 meters or about 30 feet.
      When the PIR sensor detects any motion, the output of the sensor is high. This is detected by the Arduino. Arduino then communicates with the GSM module via serial communication to make a call to the pre programmed mobile number.
